This project aims to transform the traditional approach to teaching sorting and searching algorithms by integrating them into a gamified learning platform. Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort, are fundamental in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), but students often find them abstract and difficult to understand. To enhance engagement and comprehension, we will use a Sorting-AlgoVisualizer to enable hands-on, interactive learning with visual representations and game-based challenges.

The Sorting and Searching Visualizer project aims to create an interactive, game-based platform to help students understand data structure and algorithm (DSA) concepts. By visualizing various sorting and searching algorithms, this tool provides a hands-on approach for learners to grasp how algorithms work in real-time. The engaging nature of the visualizer will enhance the learning experience for students, especially those studying computer science or preparing for technical interviews
